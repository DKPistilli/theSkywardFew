##Todo List
- sketch the design outline of the individual character pages
- write the individual character pages for the following (or ask their players for them):
  - mordinar
  - boost
  - Johnny
  - hothral
  - Ymute
  - Kuma
- add names to front page somewhere? maybe on highlight? their absence is starting to bug me instead of seeming like a cool design
- verify that logo and title logo are being designed, if not design myself
- replace title, and add tab logo
- finish all of the different class icons (for modularity sake. its gonna be annoying in the future when class icons are missing)

##(completed)
- sketch and decide on design of main characters page (avengers img style)
- build main character page
  - set up cols and divs
  - divide between character and dndClass section
  - place title @ top and pick font for stub until logo designed
- Find images for each characters preview screen
- Find images for each class distinction
- alter the images for each character preview screen to fit dimensions
- alter the images for each class distinction to fit dimensions

##Known Bugs
- None currently known, but site still unfinished && untested
